## Loading development extension
To load an unpacked extension in developer mode:

Go to the Extensions page by entering chrome://extensions in a new tab. (By design chrome:// URLs are not linkable.)

Alternatively, click on the Extensions menu puzzle button and select Manage Extensions at the bottom of the menu.
Or, click the Chrome menu, hover over More Tools, then select Extensions.
Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.

Click the Load unpacked button and select the extension directory.

After saving the file, to see this change in the browser you also have to refresh the extension. Go to the Extensions page and click the refresh icon next to the on/off toggle. Not all components need to be reloaded to see changes made.
